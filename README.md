# DARIAH-DE GitHub Organisation

This is the GitHub organisation of [DARIAH-DE](https://de.dariah.eu).



1. The code repositories are maintained by members of the DARIAH-DE consortium.
2. Maintainers are indicated from the repository's Readme.
3. Repository's without a maintainer get [archived](https://help.github.com/articles/archiving-a-github-repository/)
and the Readme's title carries an appropriate badge:
    ```markdown
    # Title ![unmaintained](https://img.shields.io/badge/repository-unmaintained-red.svg)
    ```
