# DARIAH-DE GitHub Organisation

This is the GitHub organisation of [DARIAH-DE](https://de.dariah.eu).


1. The organisation is managed by the DARIAH-DE Coordination Office,
   which manages access permissions and oversees compliance with our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
2. The organisation's code repositories are maintained by members of the DARIAH-DE consortium,
   the individual maintainers are indicated in the repository's Readme.
4. Repository's without a maintainer get [archived](https://help.github.com/articles/archiving-a-github-repository/)
   and the Readme's title carries an appropriate badge:
    ```markdown
